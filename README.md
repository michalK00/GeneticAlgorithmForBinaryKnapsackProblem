# Binary Knapsack Problem Genetic Algorithm

Project created as part of the Effective Progamming Techniques course. This is a genetic algorithm that solves the binary knapsack problem.
The data is taken from a file, or directly from the program itself.

Template for the input file:
```txt
NumberOfItems BackPackSize
FirstItemValue FirstItemSize
SecondItemValue SecondItemSize
...
```
and so on... </br>
Here's an example:

```txt
5 126
44 92
46 4
90 43
72 83
91 84
```
